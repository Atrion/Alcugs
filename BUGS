Ok, this list contains a list of known bugs and issues.
We are working to fix them up.

Vault
* Vault task RegisterVisitAge is not working. This causes the issues related
 with books that don't work if you are not owner of the age. (see the Relto bookself)
* Some ages are not sending the correct linking rules, and then they fail to send
the RegisterOwnedAge vault task.

General
* Loadclone issues.

* Member list bug.

* Cannot bind 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1, causes a lot of problems. All runs fine if you bind
  to a fixed address.
