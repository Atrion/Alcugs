Ok, this list contains a list of known bugs and issues.
We are working to fix them up.

Game/Vault (vclient communications)
* Vault task RegisterVisitAge is not working. This causes the issues related
 with books that don't work if you are not owner of the age. (see the Relto bookself)
* Some ages are not sending the correct linking rules, and then they fail to send
the RegisterOwnedAge vault task.
* Client crashes on first logon for first avatar of a fresh vault. Reason seems to be that the vault
 needs too long to send the ack and the message is sent and parsed twice, resulting in some chaos
 and the client being kicked due to a flood

General
* Loadclone issues

* Member list bug
