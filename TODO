Tracking
========
* Only tell new players to go to a game server if we have confirmation from the game server that it is alife

Vault
===========
* Implement permissions
* Vault must be asked to find an age before tracking is asked to find the server (no more GUID gen in tracking!)
  regard linking rule while doing that:
  We need a list of instanced and a list of non-instanced ages
  kBasicLink with GUID set => we don't have to do anything (link from foreign Relto to one of the owner's ages)
  kBasicLink without GUID => GlobalAge, not allowed for ages which are in one of the list (for fan-ages only).
  kOwnedBook, kVisitBook => GUID must be already present.
  kOriginalBook => GUID must not be present. Generate GUID according to list, fail if it's on neither list.
                   If age already exists we have to somehow reset it.
  Of course the even better solution would be to find a way to get rid of at least one of these lists
