Vault
===========
* Take linking rule into account while generating the GUID:
  We use a list of ages that are global even though the linking rules requests an owned book.
  kBasicLink with GUID set => we don't have to do anything (link from foreign Relto to one of the owner's ages)
  kBasicLink without GUID => Global age (for fan-ages, Eder Delin & Tsogal and so on), register the age somewhere in the vault tree
  kOwnedBook, kVisitBook => GUID must be already present.
  kOriginalBook => GUID must not be present. Generate GUID according to list, if the GUID is already used something went crazy.
  kSubAgeBook => ?

Game
======
* Marge game state from file, age vault and global SDL

Generic Stuff
==================
* Prefer tString over str[n]cpy/str[n]cat
* Implement server identification (this could also be used for the tNetSession::isAlcugsServer function)
* Multithreading support
* UU support
* Public ages
