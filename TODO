Tracking
========
* Only tell new players to go to a game server if we have confirmation from the game server that it is alife

Vault
===========
* Implement permissions
* Vault must be asked to find an age before tracking is asked to find the server (no more GUID gen in tracking!)
  regard linking rule while doing that:
  We use a list of ages that are global even though the linking rules requests an owned book.
  kBasicLink with GUID set => we don't have to do anything (link from foreign Relto to one of the owner's ages)
  kBasicLink without GUID => Global age (for fan-ages, Eder Delin & Tsogal and so on), register the age somewhere in the vault tree
  kOwnedBook, kVisitBook => GUID must be already present.
  kOriginalBook => GUID must not be present. Generate GUID according to list, if the GUID is already used something went crazy.

Game
======
* Marge game state from file, age vault and global SDL

Generic Stuff
==================
* Implement server Identification. This could also be used to force custom flags not to be used outside internal communication.
* Full Multithreaded support
* UU support

Feature-Requests list
