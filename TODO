NetCore
============
* Finish the threaded implementation
* Implement the save Bandwidth thingy
* Fix some free() problems
* Fix the 256KBytes max message size problem
* Fix some exploits

Auth
========
* Allow admins to select wich client versions they want
* Implement additional cryptographic asimetric authentication extension
* Implement server Identification

Tracking
========
* Optimizations
* Tracking should somehow tell a game server that a player will soon come so that this server can
  (a) avoid to go down due to inactivity before the player can connect
  (b) tell everyone the player is dead if he does not come

Vault
===========
* Optimizations
* Implement permissions
* Fix some vault server based exploits
* Implement vault server side limits
* WorkAround against invalid SDL nodes
* Finish the Postgres driver
* Finish the filesystem driver
* Vault must be asked to find an age before tracking is asked to find the server (no more GUID gen in tracking!)
  regard linking rule while doing that:
  We need a list of instanced and a list of non-instanced ages
  kBasicLink with GUID set => we don't have to do anything (link from foreign Relto to one of the owner's ages)
  kBasicLink without GUID => GlobalAge, not allowed for ages which are in one of the list (for fan-ages only).
  kOwnedBook, kVisitBook => GUID must be already present.
  kOriginalBook => GUID must not be present. Generate GUID according to list, fail if it's on neither list.
                   If age already exists we have to somehow reset it.
  Of course the even better solution would be to find a way to get rid of at least one of these lists
