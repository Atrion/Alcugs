These are the basic developer coding guidelines:

1) Please read alcPrefixes.txt, we are attempting to use that naming schema on
 any new code. The proposed schema is still not finished and it may change in
 the future.

2) Identation: In order to make the code readable, everything should be idented
 with one TAB. (no spaces) [adjust your editor tab size to your prefered one]
 You are not allowed to re-ident or re-format any old code mainly because it's
 very anonying.

3) We are trying to have all the sources documented with Doxygen, please read
 their website for more info, and try to document the new pieces of code.

4) Changes that will affect to the database format, or a changes in the format
 of the configuraion files, or changes in how the source tree is organized need
 to be discussed with the other devs.
