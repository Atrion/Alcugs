Alcugs library naming schema.
=============================

On an attempt to re-structure everything, several functions
and structures are going to be renamed.

Proposed:

* Several code is going to be moved to the "alc" namespace.

* "anythingwiththatname" will be now "AnythingWithThatName", or "anyThingWithThatName".

* All function names, now will start with "alcMyFuncName()"
* Structs and classes will start with prefix "t". (tBBuf, tAgeLinkStruct, tUnet, tUstr, tStr, tBuf, tFBuf, tZBuf)
* Underscores "_" are going to be removed, and "this_name" will be replaced with "ThisName"
* Exceptions will start with "tx". (txNoFile, txTooLong, txTooBig, txNoName, ...)
* Messages will start with "tm". (tmNetMsgPing, tmNetMsgVoice, tmNetCustomMsgXX, ...)
* Private vars in a module will be tvVarName or txvVarName
* Class methods will start with the first letter in lowercase.

* Python docs suggests to don't use the "py" prefix anywhere.
* All exposed functions to python, will start with the "Pt" prefix
* Python classes will start with "pt"
* Methods of python classes will start in lowercase.

* All source files, will contain the SVN tag $Id$.
* On header files, this tag is __U_FILENAME_H_ID
* On source files, this tag is __U_FILENAME_ID
