01/Dec/2004 - Release 1.1.15 (pre)
===========================================================================0

 * Small change in the vault format, wipe is recomened, but not required,
   the vault will be automatically converted to the new format.
   It's extremely recomended to do a backup of your vault if you apreciate
   it a lot.
 * Experimental Multiple instance mode is now enabled by default,
   AvatarCustomization, Personal & Nexus are now private ages.
   I think that it's fun to have Cleft as a shared age, if it causes
   problems, you can make it private by adding it to the list.
 * Now, you can easily add new ages to the server. The server will allow you
   to link only to the ages that are listed inside the tracking/vault/lobby 
   age folders.

20/Nov/2004 - Release 1.1.14
===========================================================================0

 * Some sdl stuff has been implemented that will allow you to do
   more things than the previous version. There are still some
   known nasty bugs. You can succesfully solve Cleft now, also
   other ages may be solvable, there are still problems with the
   camera and the cursor, that may be caused by some missing game
   messages. Be aware that the game servers are still not storing
   the progress in the filesystem or the vault, each time that
   you link into the age again, all the progress will be reset
   to the default values. (You should be able to do the path
   of the shell puzzle, it will be funny to see someone else playing
   with the big ball...)
 * For the next version there are major changes planned, all the
   SDL parsing functions are going to be rewritten from scratch, and
   then it will be more easy to store things in the vault.
