Alcugs Uru server project. See http://alcugs.almlys.org for an archive of (not only) Alcugs-related information.


Status
------

The software is still in Beta stage.
Check the file TODO to see what is still not implemented.
Read the file COPYING and DISCLAIMER to check the license.
Read the ChangeLog, to see, how is going all.


For the impatient
-----------------
Congratulations, you have arrived here, now continue reading! :)


Installation
------------

The installation is described in the INSTALL file.


Configuring
-----------

Read the uru.conf.dist file for more info. It explains the most important variables, and how to configure them.
You can find a complete list in the CONFIG file.


Running
-------

Well, the best way is to run it as the nobody user, you can also create an user called alcugs,
and run it as this user. Never run it as the superuser, or with an user with some privileges.
Also a chrooted jail will add more security.


Helping
-------

You want to help, or join the project?

Then, is very simple, read the file HELPING.

What is required?

* Well, mainly C/C++ programmers to code the server.
* Write documentation. This is basic, the programmers do the code, and then the user write the
 documentation, you can rewrite this README and make it more clear for some people.
* Porting to other OSes.


What to do if It doesn't work?
-----------------------------

If you are reading this, then is because it is not working.
Is expected to have several problems. I'm sure that it compiles without
problems on Debian Etch and Ubuntu where it is being developed.

Please go to the forums at http://forum.guildofwriters.org/ or http://forum.almlys.org/ and ask
for help.
