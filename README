Alcugs Uru server project.

==========
= Status =
==========

The software is still in Alpha stage.

Check the file TODO to see what is still not implemented.

Read the file COPYING and DISCLAIMER to check the license.

Read the ChangeLog, to see, how is going all.

=====================
= For the impatient =
=====================
Congratulations, you have arrived here, now continue reading! :)

========================================================
= Requirements for Building the servers, tools and API =
========================================================

You need to have installed the development headers and libraries of:
* openssl
* mysql
* zlib
* python
* wxwidgets (for GUI based apps)
* And anything else that I forgot

========================
= Building the servers =
========================

(A) If you are on Linux or a similar *nix system
------------------------------------------------

1) If you are building from SVN, or a snapshot, you need to have:
 autoconf and automake tools.
 Then you need to run the reconf.sh script by typing

$ ./reconf.sh


2) Run configure

$ ./configure

3) Run make

$ make all


(B) If you are using 'windows'
------------------------------

A) Upgrade your OS to Linux (recommended)

or

B) Build with Cygwin

1) Download and install Cygwin
2) Download mysql with the C API
3) download python 2.2 with the dev headers
4) Fix the Makefiles
5) Compile by the same way
(I wish you luck ;) )

or

C) Build with MinGW

1) Download and install MinGW or Dev-Cpp
2) And do the same as B).

or

D) Build with MSVC

1) There are some files that should allow you to compile with MSVC.


==============
= Installing =
==============

A) Automated installation (*UNTESTED* and BROKEN!!!)

1) Run make install

$ make install

2) Copy the client sdl and age files inside the lobby/sdl and lobby/age folders.

--

B) Manual installation (recommended)

1) Search for the server binaries, and copy them to the place that you wish.

2) If everything when well, you only need to understand the uru.conf file, and you need
to configure it for your purposes.
Then you can start the servers. There is a script somewhere that should allow you to start
them.
You can also manually start the servers in the following order.

uru_auth -D
uru_vault -D
uru_tracking -D
uru_lobby -D

NOTE FOR UNET3 BRANCH: The unet3 Game server is not finished, and not useful for playing it,
you will need to replace the binary uru_game with an older one, and use the game.config option
pointing to an old configuration file.

NOTE FOR UNET3+ BRANCH: The unet3+ branch servers are broken and not working, I suggest you
waiting a little, sometimes you may be able to compile working experimental versions.


Configuring
-----------

Read the uru.conf.dist file for more info. It explains each variable, and how to configure it.

For admin access:
 1) Log into the game.
 2) run the script/addadmin.sh and answer well to all the questions.

Running
-------

Well, the best way is to run it as the nobody user, you can also create an user called Uru,
and run it as this user. Never run it as the superuser, or with an user with some privileges.
Also a chrooted jail will add more security.

Helping
-------

You want to help, or join the project?

Then, is very simple, read the file HELPING.

What is required?

* Well, mainly C/C++ programmers to code the server.
* Write documentation. This is basic, the programmers do the code, and then the user write the
 documentation, you can rewrite this README and make it more clear for some people.
 I REALLY NEED SOMEONE TO WRITE DOCUMENTATION. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIME CONSUMES TO WRITE THESE DOCS?
* Porting to other OSes.


What To Do if It don't works?
-----------------------------

If you are reading this, then is because it is not working.
Is expected to have several problems. I'm sure that it compiles without
problems on Debian Sarge where it is being developed.

Please go to the forums at http://alcugs.almlys.dyns.net/forum and ask
for help.
