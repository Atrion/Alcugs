Alcugs H'uru server emulator project.

Status
------
Check the file TODO to see what is still not implented.

Read the file COPYING and DISCLAIMER to check the license.

Read the ChangeLog, to see, how is going all.


For the impatient
-----------------
Congratulations, you have arribed here, now continue reading! :)


Requirements for Building the servers, tools and API
----------------------------------------------------

You need to have installed the development headers and libraries of:
* openssl
* mysql
* zlib
* python


Compiling
---------

Simple, like others:
if you are using linux type in your command prompt:

$ make all

(There could be some minor problems on other *nix systems)

If you are using 'windows'.

A) Upgrade your OS to Linux

or

B) Build with Cygwin

1) Download and install Cygwin
2) Download mysql with the C API
3) download python 2.2 with the dev headers
4) Fix the Makefiles
5) Compile by the same way

or

C) Build with MinGW

1) Download and intall MinGW or Dev-Cpp
2) And do the same as B).

or

D) Build with MSVC

1) There are some files that should allow you to compile with MSVC.



Installing
----------

NOTE AUTOMATED INSTALLATION IS BROKEN, PLEASE USE MANUAL INSTALLATION!
A) Automated installation:

Type
./install.sh [destination]
or
make install

then,
copy the client sdl and age files inside the lobby/sdl and lobby/age folders.

--

B) Manual installation:
1) If everything when well, you only need to understand the uru.conf file, and you need
to configure it for your purposes.
Then you can start the servers. There is a script somewhere that should allow you to start
them.
You can also manually start the servers in the following order.

uru_auth -D
uru_vault -D
uru_tracking -D
uru_lobby -D

NOTE FOR UNET3 BRANCH: The unet3 Game server is not finished, and not useful for playing it,
you will need to replace the binary uru_game with an older one, and use the game.config option
pointing to an old configuration file.


Configuring
-----------

Read the uru.conf file for more info. It explains each variable, and how to configure it.

For admin access:
 1) Log into the game.
 2) run the script/addadmin.sh and answer well to all the questions.

Running
-------

Well, the best way is to run it as the nobody user, you can also create an user called Uru,
and run it as this user. Never run it as the superuser, or with an user with some privilegues.
Also a chrooted jail will add more security.

Helping
-------

You want to help, or join the project?

Then, is very simple, read the file HELPING.

What is required?

* Well, mainly C/C++ programers to code the server.
* Write documentation. This is basic, the programers do the code, and then the user write the
 documentation, you can rewrite this README and make it more clear for some people.
* Dedicated servers: Yes, we need dedicated servers (you must have root access), then we can test
 upcoming builds of the server, and P2P technology.
* Porting to other OSes.


What To Do if It don't works?
-----------------------------

If you are reading this, then is because it is not working.
Is expected to have several problems. I'm sure that it compiles without
problems on Debian Sarge where it is being developed.
You will need to send me, or post to the forums the output of the
compilation results.

If you have a problem related with the compiled servers, then you will need
to send me the log files, and or copy the last lines from the stdout
of the server that crashed.
