= Alcugs Configuration Directives =

Please note that the default values might have been different in older versions, I try to keep them up-to-date to the latest unet3+ revision.

== Syntax ==

<alcugs>
# This is a comment
; This is also a comment
[this_is_a_key]
this_is_a_subkey = "this is the value"

[this_is_another_key]
this_is_a_tuple[0] = "one","two","three"
this_is_a_tuple[1] = "four","five","six"
</alcugs>

The last entry always overrides the previous one. For example:
<alcugs>
port = 4664

# ... other stuff ...

port = 8393
</alcugs>
The final port value will be 8393.

There is a generic "global" key that defines options for all servers. In addition, there is one key per server ("auth", "vault" and so on). Options made in this key overwrite the same options from the global key for this server:
<alcugs>
[global]
port = 7373
[auth]
port = 7316
</alcugs>
Then the auth server will use port 7316, and the others will use port 7373.

Default value: None (must be set)
Context: Vault, Tracking and Game
Versions: All

It's only a debugging option that should not be used on production servers.

Default value:1
Context: All
Versions: All

== load_on_demand ==
Enables the automatic spawning of game servers when a player links to an specific age. This is also a debugging option, if load on demand is disabled you need to manually start the desired game server.

Default value:1
Context: All
Versions: All

== log_files_path ==
Sets where the logs are stored.

Default value: "./log"

Default value: 5
Context: All
Versions: unet3+

== net.down ==
Specifies your internet connection downstream in bits per second. If the deprecated "bandwidth" value is set and "net.down" is not, bandwidth will be used (in bit/s, too!).

Default value: 512000 (512 kbit/s)

Context: All
Versions: unet3+

== net.lan.up ==
Specifies your LAN connection upstream in bits per second. What is LAN and what not is defined by the [[#private_mask|private_mask]] and [[#private_network|private_network]] values.

Default value: 100000000 (100 MBit/s)
Context: All
Versions: unet3+

== net.log.ack ==
Specifies whether the server should keep a HTML logfile about each acked and each ack packet. This is useful to analyze connection problems, but makes the server run slower.

Default value: 0
Context: All

Sets the maximum number of connections the server will accept. A value of 0 means that so restriction is applied.

Default value: 0

Context: All
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== net.timeout.loading ==
Specifies how many seconds the connection to an Uru client which just loads an age can be idle before it is terminated. This will be overwritten after the player finished loading. If you encounter disconnects while linking to big ages, you could try increasing it - but I strongly suggest not to go above 180 seconds as this timeout also defines the time it takes the server to know the client crashed or left!

Default value: 90
Context: Game
Versions: unet3+

== net.timer ==
Sets the netcore idle loop time in seconds (Suggested the default value)

Default value: 10
Context: All
Versions: unet3+

== net.up ==
Specifies your internet connection upstream in bits per second. If the deprecated "bandwidth" value is set and "net.up" is not, bandwidth will be used (in bit/s, too!).

Default value: 128000 (128 kbit/s)
Context: All
Versions: unet3+

== port ==
set the port where this server is going to listen. If you set this in the game section, it will be ignored since the game server port is defined by the lobby starting it.

Default value:0
Context: All
Versions: All

== private_ages ==
Sets a coma separated list of ages that will have private instantiation. Each player will have his own instance of that age. Personal must be always a private age to avoid several nasty bugs, it's also strongly recommended to set AvatarCutomization as a private age. Nexus can be public, but not recmomended if you have a lot of players. BahroCave must also be private or you may see some weird things when two players appear on two different pedestals.

This is only regarded if [[#instance_mode|instance_mode]] is set correctly.

Default value: "AvatarCustomization,Personal,Nexus,BahroCave,BahroCave02,LiveBahroCaves,DniCityX2Finale,Cleft,Kadish,Gira,Garrison,Garden,Teledahn,Ercana,Minkata,Jalak"
Context: Tracking, Vault, Game
Versions: All

== private_mask ==

The value must be a valid 4 number doted address.

Default value: 255.255.255.0
Context: All
Versions: All

== private_network ==
If your server has two different IP addresses, or is behind a NAT, you need to specify the address of your local network. This address is used to determine when a connection is inside or outside of your local network, and depending of the decision the server will announce a different connection speed.

The value must be a valid 4 number doted address.

Default value: 172.26.0.0
Context: All
Versions: All

== public_address ==
The address that will be announced to the clients to connect to your game servers. This is your public IP address, the one used to access your server. If you have a dynamic ip address, it is suggested to set a domain address such as the ones offered by [http://no-ip.org No-IP] or [http://dyndns.com DynDNS]

The value can be a hostname, or an ip address.

Default value: bind address
Context: All
Versions: All

== read_config ==

Remember the override rule.

== sdl ==
Sets the path where all the SDL files are stored.

Default value: None (must be set)
Context: Game
Versions: All

== shard.identifier ==
Set the Shard identifier that can be requested by the client using "/!getshardidentifier"

== spawn.start ==
Sets the firts port of the port range where the lobby server will be allowed to spawn game servers.

Default value: 5001
Context: Lobby, Game
Versions: All (broken on some old versions)

== spawn.stop ==
Sets the last port of the port range where the lobby server will be allowed to spawn game servers.

Default value: 6000
Context: Lobby, Game
Versions: All (broken on some old versions)

These options are useful if you want to run several shards on the same IP address, or if you need to share the same IP with plasma. The only problem is that there isn't yet any client that allows you to connect to a lobby server running on a port different to the 5000.

== stop ==
If this value is set the server will not start up.

Default value: 0
Context: All
Versions: unet3/unet3+

Sets the path for the track.xml file.

Default value: None (must be set for the page to work)
Context: Tracking
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== tracking ==
Sets the tracking server address. This option is usually overwritten by the [[#bind|bind]] option set in the tracking section, which should be set to "localhost".

Default value: None
Context: Lobby, Game
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== tracking.log ==
When enabled, the tracking server keeps a logfile about players going offline and online as well game server being requested, spawned and going down.

Default value: 1
Context: Tracking
Versions: unet3+

== tracking.port ==
Sets the tracking server port. This option is usually overwritten by the [[#port|port]] option set in the tracking section, which should be set to "2010".

Default value: None

Versions: unet3/unet3+

== vault ==
Sets the vault server address. This option is usually overwritten by the [[#bind|bind]] option set in the vault section, which should be set to "localhost".

Default value: None
Context: Lobby, Game
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== vault.clean ==
Performs a clean-up on the vault database (removes invalid and unreachable nodes). This can only be set via command line ("-clean"), and the server will immediately exit after having done the clean-up.

Default value: 0
Context: Vault
Versions: unet3+

== vault.clean.ages ==
If this is set to 1, a vault clean-up will also removed ages which are no longer referenced anywhere. While this will remove a lot of ages from deleted players, I can't assure it won't delete some global instances, too, so please use it with care!

Default value: 0
Context: Vault
Versions: unet3+

== vault.hood.desc ==
Sets the default hood description.

Default value: "This is a hood on an Alcugs server"
Context: Vault

Default value: 5
Context: Vault
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== vault.port ==
Sets the vault server port. This option is usually overwritten by the [[#port|port]] option set in the vault section, which should be set to "2010".

Default value: None
Context: Lobby, Game
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== vault.html.log ==
When enabled, the vault-subsystem will keep an HTML logfile containing incoming and outgoing vault messages. Disabling it will increase server performance, but make debugging vault problems almost impossible. I recommend to enable it and set [[#vault.html.log.short|vault.html.log.short]] to 0.

Default value: 1
Context: Lobby, Game, Vault
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== vault.html.log.short ==
If [[#vault.html.log|vault.html.log]] is enabled, this variable controls whether the vault log should be kept short by leaving out some details (which will save about 75% of the needed disk space and drastically increase server performance) or whether everything should be logged and the binaty part of the nodes should be dumped to disk.

Default value: 1
Context: Lobby, Game, Vault
Versions: unet3/unet3+

== vault.tmp.hacks.linkrules ==
Workaround for non-working linking rules for Myst, Ahnonay and Kveer.

Default value: "Shorah b'shehmtee, this Shard is running the Alcugs server software.
Thanks for your support!
Welcome to the new adventure, feel free to explore Er'cana or any other age. Be careful if you see new books, some explorers have found some Kortee'nea and other ancient technology in a secret room in Kirel DRC neighborhood, and they are starting to learn the art of writting."
Context: All
Versions: unet3/unet3+
