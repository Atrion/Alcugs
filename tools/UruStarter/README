UruStarter is a little application meant to be put into the Uru startup process between UruSetup and UruExplorer. After having done its work, UruStarter will run UruExplorer itself, so the user won't notice a difference. It can perform various cleanups, fixing the flaw that the dataserver can not remove files, but Uru will in some case load all files from a directory (like prp files in dat, or pak files in Python). In addition, it has a widescreen patch built in, allowing players to use their native screen resolution (Uru will still stretch the picture, but without artifacts).

To build it, you will need Qt: http://qt.nokia.com/
