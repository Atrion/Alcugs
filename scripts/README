These are come scripts which are useful when running an Alcugs Shard:

- adduser.php (my MercAngel): Copy this somewhere into your webserver's htdocs directory. It creates users for the Shard.
  To make a user an admin, create it normally and then use phpmyadmin or something similar to change the access level to 0 (meaning full access)
- control-servers.sh: After chaning some paths at the beginning of the file, this script can be used to start and stop the Alcugs servers.
- log-filter.sh: run it in the log-directory of one of the servers with "problems" or "infos" as argument.
  It will filter the logfiles accordingly.
