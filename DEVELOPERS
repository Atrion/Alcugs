These are the basic developer guidelines:

* First the main, and unical repository where all
modifications need to be commited is currently
at almlys.dyns.net.
There are plans for a migration to a SVN repository, but
not at this time.

For a CVS account you need to read the HELPING file.

The anonymous cvs acces is done by this way:

1) You need a CVS client.

2) Type:
cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@almlys.dyns.net:/cvs login

3) When you are asked for the password type:
cvs

4) To retrieve the entire tree type:
cvs -z5 -d :pserver:cvsguest@almlys.dyns.net:/cvs co uru_server3

You can also brownse the CVS reposistory at:
http://uru:rocks@almlys.dyns.net/cgi-stuff/viewcvs.cgi

But we always recomend you to download the pre-compiled stable versions, 
the nightly builds, and the static stable source trees automatically created
by the system at:
http://alcugs.almlys.dyns.net

* Second: All the sources are nicely idented with only one TAB.
Please use only the key TAB for the identation. You should also configure
your editor to display a TAB of 2 spaces of size.
This rule is not a Must in new pieces of source, but I will kill if someone
destroys the identation in the old sources without adding nothing new.

* Third: We are trying to have all the sources documented with Doxygen,
please read their website for more info, and try to document the new pieces
of code.

* Four: Development shard. almlys.dyns.net is also the development shard, it
will automatically pop up a new version every week. (Or on request)
Currently the access is public to anybody with a Cyan account, if we can't
manage the load, we will make the access private to some users.

* Five: We have a mailing list here: http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=122730
for discussion about the development. It's strongly recomended to subscribe to this
list.
